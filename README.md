# Monster Platformer
A small platformer created for studies. I mostly tried to make the game look as good as it can be with all of the importet assets and animations. Additionally as first level is done manually, the second one is a simple generated level based on a few made prefabs that are shuffled. The project works both on PC and Android devices.
